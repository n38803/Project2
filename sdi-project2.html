<p>For this project I had decided to follow along with my prior story, involving a phone repair shop in dire need of some assistance!  Essentially, the manager is attempting to delegate the workload based off of how long the store is open, how many repairs need to be done, as well as how many employees he has staffed.  Ultimately, the stress seems to take control and he just loses it on his employees and fires everyone.  It is a rather unfortunate turn of events.</p>
